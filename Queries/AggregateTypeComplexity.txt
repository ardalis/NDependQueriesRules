// <Description>
// **Aggregate Type Complexity (ATC)** sums up method complexity using a point system where complexity levels of 1-9
// are 0 points, 10-19 are 1 point, 20-29 are 2 points, etc. Types that only have methods with less than 10
// complexity will have an ATC score of 0. Higher scores represent legitimate complexity within types, not just
// the presence of many single-path methods or properties.
