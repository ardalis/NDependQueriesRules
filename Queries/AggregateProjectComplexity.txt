// <Description>
// **Aggregate Project Complexity (APC)** sums up method complexity using a point system where complexity levels of 1-9
// are 0 points, 10-19 are 1 point, 20-29 are 2 points, etc. Projects that only have classes with methods with 
// less than 10 cyclomatic complexity will have an APC score of 0. Higher scores represent legitimate complexity
// within projects/assemblies, not just the presence of many single-path methods or properties on the contained types.
